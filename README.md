# Navi

Navi is an OS environment based on [Ubuntu Gnome](https://ubuntugnome.org/).

## Installing

Run every script as root. If a script doesn't require root, it will tell you.

First, run `navi/init.sh` first and then copy `bashrc` to `$HOME/.bashrc`

```shell
$ cd navi
$ sudo ./init.sh
$ cp bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

Then install vim, chrome, each of the gui scripts, and the gestures setup.
